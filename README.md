# simple-wordpress-docker
A very basic script to stand up a fully functional wordpress site in a minute, requiring no manual work.

Just run setup.sh. 

The script will download a mysql image and a wordpress image. 

It will expose port 8080 to your host. Connect on that port and you will be presented with the setup wizard. 

The sql directory and website directory will be exposed into this repository under /sql and /www

I highly recommend installing the Jetpack plugin afterwards to get all the functionality of wordpress.com hosted sits.
